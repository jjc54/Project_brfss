## Purpose

Temporal analysis (at least 10 years) of HPV screening/vaccination and cervical cancer diagnosis by [sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI).]{.underline}

-   2014-2023 (2023 not yet available as of 20JUL2024)

-   Straight v. non-straight

    -   urban v. rural

    -   racial/ethnic

-   Cis v. trans

    -   urban v. rural

    -   racial/ethnic

## Temporal Amalgamation

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

library(readxl) # Importing Excel files
library(here) # Managing nested directories 
library(tidyverse) # Data wrangling, viz
library(gt) # For table generation

# Construct the path to the codebook using here
codebook_path <- here("Data", "codebook.xlsx")

# Read the Excel file
codes <- read_xlsx(codebook_path, sheet = "Current_Codebook")
```

```{r}

codes %>%
  gt() %>%
  opt_interactive(
    use_search=TRUE,
    use_filters=TRUE
  )
```

## Variable Breakdown for Potential Harmonizing

::: callout-warning
*\*Need 2023 data release to have 10 years for temporal paper.*
:::

### Survey Design, Survey Stratification, Survey Weighting - GOT IT

### Sex - GOT IT (see notes)

-   2022-2019 = X_SEX

-   2018 = SEX_1

-   2017-2014 = SEX

### Sexual Orientation - GOT IT (see notes)

-   2022-2018 = SOMALE (for sex=male), SOFEMALE (for sex=female)

-   2017-2014 = SXORIENT (need to subset by Sex to match SOMALE and SOFEMALE)

### Gender Identity - GOT IT

### Urban v. Rural - GOT IT (see notes)

-   Use MSCODE for all years

-   More specifics available for 2022-2018 via X_URBSTAT and X_METSTAT (don't use?)

### HPV Vaccination - GOT IT (see notes)

-   2022-2020 = HPVADVC4, HPVADSHT

-   2019 = HPVADVC3, HPVADSHT

-   2018-2014 = HPVADVC2, HPVADSHT

### HPV Testing (MAY BE A PART OF PAP TEST) - MISSING 1 YEAR (see notes)

-   2022-2021 = CRVCLHPV

-   2020-2018, 2016-2014 = HPVTEST, HPLSTTST

-   2017 = [MISSING]{.underline}

### Cervical Cancer Screening (AKA PAP TEST) - MISSING 1 YEAR (see notes)

-   2022-2021 = CERVSCRN, CRVCLCNC, CRVCLPAP

-   2020-2018, 2016-2014 = HADPAP2, LASTPAP2

-   2017 = [MISSING]{.underline}

### Cervical Cancer Diagnosis - MISSING 1 YEAR (see notes)

-   2022 = CNCRDIFF, CNCRAGE, CNCRTYP2

-   2021-2016, 2014 = CNCRDIFF, CNCRAGE, CNCRTYP1

-   2015 = [MISSING]{.underline}

## Summary

To complete a temporal analysis as planned, we need to wait for 2023 data. In the meantime, we can begin **cleaning and analyzing 2022-2014 data as noted above.**

We have [complete and clean data]{.underline} for the following:

-   survey design,

-   survey stratification,

-   survey weighting,

-   gender identity.

We [can engineer complete and clean data]{.underline} for:

-   sex,

-   sexual orientation,

-   urban v. rural status,

-   HPV vaccination.

We will have [incomplete but clean data (missing 1 year each)]{.underline} for:

-   HPV testing,

-   cervical cancer screening,

-   cervical cancer diagnoses.

These findings impact our timelines for the abstract and manuscript submissions, but do not impact our technical papers (which are due in the coming weeks).
